# IBM-AI-Engineering
This repository shows how I mastered the capstone projects of the IBM-AI-Engineering professional certificate, offered at Coursera. Overall the courses of this certificate aim to teach fundamental concepts of machine learning and deep learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, using programming languages like Python. Through the following four capstone projects the theoretical concepts are brought into action. These projects make hands on use of the most popular machine learning libraries scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, and Tensorflow to solve regression tasks, compare the performance of several deep model architectures, solve image classification tasks with convolutional neural networks and do transfere learning with the ResNet50 and VGG16 models.

Keywords: Machine learning, Deep learning, Regression, Classification, Tensorflow, PyTorch

The Capstone Projects:
Course number	Course name	Project name	Content
1	Machine Learning with Python	Regressor_Comparison	Binary classification: Compare the perfomance of KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regressor in predicting if a loan is paid off or in collection.
2	Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras	Deep_Learning_with_Keras	Regression: The models task is to use the numeric input features of concrete composition to predict the strength of the concrete. The performance of a deep baseline model is compared to three more deep models.
4	Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch	Deep_Nets_with_PyTorch	Multiclass classification: With the MNIST Fashion dataset two convolutional neurla networks are trained, a baseline model and one the takes advantage of batch normalization.
6	AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning	Transfere_Learning_with_Keras	Binary classification: An image classifier is built that predicts if a given image of concrete has a crack or does not show a crack. With the transfere learning approach we take advantage of the VGG16 and ResNet50 pre-trained models. Finally we use the models to predict the labels of unseen images from the test dataset.
